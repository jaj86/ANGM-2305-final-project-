## Description
My final project is a game like pac-man the final project is a game made with python and pygame.
This game will be an arcade style that is simple and will have moving characters.  

## Features
- playable character
	- impliment code of the character with code of the directional keys.
- moving AI
	- using import math adding speed to an AI giving random direction.
- Scoreboard
	- using font and text and linking it to objects so the score can go up.

## Challenges
- How to code AI enemies that move on there own.
- how to implement code that will allow me to have the character move and make chaarater sprites
- adding a scoreboard into the code and objects to pick up that add up to the scoreboard.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- the ideal outcome is the game will run smoothly and and a scoreboard will work and the enemies will be able to move without any problem?

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- the game runs and the AI will be able to move if there is no scoreboard see how long you can survive?

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. get the game working with no crashing 
  2. getting the playable character to move with no problems

- Week 2
  1. get a scoreboard that works added 
  2. add sprites that the character can pick up

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add AI that can move on its own
  2. Fine tune the code and see If I can make character sprites
