## Description
  My final project is a game like pac-man the final project Jewel Collector is a game made with python and pygame. This game will be an arcade style that is simple and will have moving characters. Collection and a point system. This project is my final project for my course ANGM-2305 it is to test my skills making a game building me up to the next level in learning python and making video games with python.
  
  My game Jewel Collector is supposed to be a simple game taking insperation from pac - man and learning how to make a simple game and its features in python. instead of makeing things exactly like pac-man I learned to add character sprites to the characters so they are not a bunch of shapes. Most of the features implemented in the game like the chase feature the movement and collection are like pac-man but with me learning how to put it into code.
  
  The features I added into the game are movement, collection, scoreboard, item respawn, enemies with random movement, chase feature, retry after game over. all these features are in the game itself they sound simple but putting them into code is a different story. Included in my SRC folder is my code and my character sprite png's that I used in the game.
